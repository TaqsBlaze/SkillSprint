SkillSprint is an intelligent, AI-powered tool designed to help you navigate your career journey and define personalized learning paths. By understanding your career goals, existing skills, and preferred learning style, SkillSprint provides tailored recommendations for courses, resources, and key concepts, guiding you efficiently towards your professional aspirations.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Personalized Path Generation**: Input your career goal, current skills, and preferred learning style to receive a customized learning roadmap.
* **Skill-Based Filtering**: The system intelligently suggests learning items relevant to your goal while filtering out skills you already possess.
* **Learning Style Adaptation**: Recommendations are subtly influenced by your preference for visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic learning.
* **Clear & Modern UI**: A clean, intuitive design built with Tailwind CSS for a visually appealing and seamless user experience.
* **Local-First MVP**: Easily runnable directly in your browser, providing a quick way to experience the core functionality.

## How It Works üí°

SkillSprint operates on a simple, yet effective, recommendation principle for this MVP:

1.  **Input Collection**: You provide essential information about your learning objectives and preferences.
2.  **Goal Matching**: The system attempts to match your specified career goal against a predefined set of career paths (e.g., Full-stack Developer, Data Scientist, UX Designer).
3.  **Skill & Style Filtering**: Once a path is matched, the "AI" (simulated by JavaScript logic) filters the available learning resources based on your stated current skills (to avoid recommending what you already know) and prioritizes resources aligning with your preferred learning style.
4.  **Path Presentation**: A clear, staged learning path is presented, guiding you through foundational, core, and advanced topics, along with actionable next steps.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

* **HTML5**: Provides the fundamental structure and content of the web application.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the interactive elements, handles user input, and implements the core "AI" recommendation logic.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing styling, ensuring a modern user interface.
